# Surfboard Selector Project 

## Problem Statement
A surfer who feels overwhelmed about choosing the right surfboard needs to have easy access to the right sorted information to be able to pick the best surfboard that suits their needs but faces the challenge of having to access many different websites to gather information, process this information, and make a decision.


## Tables
The app will have the following tables

 - Users: people using the app
 - Factories: surfboard factories and shapers
 - Stores: surf shop where users can buy the product
 - Surfboard: product table

## Description
This project seeks to facilitate the way surfers browse different surfboards by bringing together the main shapers and all their surfboard models.
Users need submit some information via a form about their surfing skills, physical condition, wave type, etc (home page)
The app queries the DB and renders the information according to the user's need
Users now can see surfboard models, get into the product details (results page)
Each of the surfboard models will have a details route where users can explore more about the product, find professional surfer's reviews about that surfboard, other user's comments/ratings about the model if they have use it before, where to buy, the average price, link to factory and/or shop website


## Next steps and refactoring
I want to apply extra features to this project such as:
- AI assistant chat
- Location API to show store locations to users
- About us and contact page
- Add product page: shapers can add new surfboards to the app via submitting a form
- Product comment section where users can interact with shapers to ask questions about the surfboard

## Users-stories
People who come to my website are sick of accessing many different surfboard's brands and getting overwhelmed with so may option out there. Some shapers can offer 30ish board models to people choose from. If they dont have a good knowledge about surfboard hydrodinamics, surfboard dimension etc...they wont be able to pick the right one.
In my website, people are able to access tailor search based on their profile. They can see each model's information and characteristics, watch review videos and contact their local surf shop to buy their next magic board!
